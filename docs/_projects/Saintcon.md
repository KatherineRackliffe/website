This was super fun. Lots of people seemed to like it. My Dad told me to put a reference to Sneakers in my presentation, which seemed to be everyone's favorite part. I'll see about posted the video sometime on here.

Everyone was so nice at SAINTCON! I have to admit, my favorite part was the minibadges. At SAINTCON, everyone makes these minibadges to attach to the bigger badge. People customize them with cool pictures and such. I managed to find a Mistborn pin. Once I get everyone soldered, I'll need to update this with pictures.
