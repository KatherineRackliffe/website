# ———————————About Me———————————

My name is Katherine. I'm studying cybersecurity at BYU. I'm also in the BYU Honors program, where I'm learning how to research. I'm currently working on my Honors thesis about vishing messages.

## Research

I've worked in research since I first started as a freshman at BYU, in 2021. I started with the BYU Engineering Together program, where I primarily worked with Professor Derek Hansen. This is a paper about asymmetric virtual reality games that I worked on. I helped with the workshops we studied, much of the writing, and the data analysis.

I worked in the Immerse program for two summers. This program has BYU engineering students work in research full-time. For the summer of 2023, I worked on the asymmetric virtual reality paper. For the summer of 2024, I worked on my Honors thesis. Right now, I'm working on a research project with Professor Brandt Redd, my thesis, and a small workshop study for an advanced human-computer interaction class.

I'm currently applying for grad schools, aiming for a doctorate in human-computer interaction, specializing in cybersecurity research.

I also worked on a website for BYU's language exam registration. This site ran on PHP. I fixed security issues and presented about these issues during BYU's cybersecurity symposium. 

I started working as a TA for IT&C 210, Web Systems + Security. I help students with their websites and have spent a lot of time debugging AWS.
