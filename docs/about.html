    <h1>———————————About Me———————————</h1>
    <p>My name is Katherine. I'm studying cybersecurity at BYU. I'm also in the BYU Honors program, where I'm learning how to research. 
        I'm currently working on my Honors thesis about vishing messages.
    </p>
    <h2> Research </h2>
    <br>
    <p> I've worked in research since when I first started as a freshman at BYU, in 2021. I started with the BYU Engineering Together program, where I primarily worked with
        Professor Derek Hansen. This is a paper about asymmetric virtual reality games that I worked on. I helped with the workshops we studied, much of the writing, and the data analysis.

    <p> I worked in the Immerse program for two summers. This program has BYU engineering students work in research full time. For the summer of 2023, I worked on the asymmetric virtual
        reality paper. For the summer of 2024, I worked on my Honors thesis. Right now, I'm working on a research project with Professor Brandt Redd, my thesis, and a small workshop study for an 
        advanced human-computer interaction class.
    </p>
    <p> I'm working on applying for grad schools right now. I want to work towards doctorate in human-computer interaction, and specialize in cybersecurity research.</p>
