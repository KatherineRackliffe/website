### Making a favicon

I've made the favicon for this website! I made it using pixalart, with a size of 100x100. Here's the image in the regular size.

![image-title-here](/assets/images/favicon.png){:class="img-responsive"}

And if everything worked, you should be able to see the favicon on this website tab. Favicons are tricky because they need to be small and easy to read, but there's only so many configurations of pixals you can make.
