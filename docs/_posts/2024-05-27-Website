So this will be a bit of a meta blog post, because it's about this website! I want this to be a personal site that I can put all my fun little projects on, and also it's tied to my name, which I think is pretty cool. 

I don't know how often I'll be writing blog posts. Most often I might just put essays I'm particularly proud of in here. We'll see!
